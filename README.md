# Safe-City-Understanding-Diverse-Forms-of-Sexual-Harassment-Personal-Stories
To automate the categorizing and evaluating several forms of sexual harassment: commenting, ogling, and groping , which aims to advance the battle against such harassment and abuse using Machine Learning models


This project is based on the Research paper titled "SafeCity: Understanding Diverse Forms of Sexual Harassment Personal Stories" by Sweta Karlekar, Mohit Bansal

Objective:
To classify if a personal story falls into either of the following categories or not - Commenting, Groping or Ogling.

Data Type:
Text data

ML Problem:
Three binary classification models - Commenting or Not Commenting, Groping or not Groping and Ogling or not Ogling

Performance Metric:
Accuracy and F1 score

Results:
Commenting or Not Commenting Accuracy - 79%
Groping or Not Groping Accuracy - 82%
Ogling or Not Ogling Accuracy - 83%
